# Documentation of `tikzmusic`

> Note that the `doc` subdirectory doesn't follow the TDS structure. That is my intention, and it will remain so, at least during this alpha stage.

To build the manual, you only have to run

```sh
$ ./build.sh
```

Note that you need to have Pygments installed and `minted` working properly.
