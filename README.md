# tikzmusic

## Installation

Currently this is not published on CTAN (and it won't be published any time soon I think). So the only way to use this package is by cloning this repository and extract it to your `texmf` tree (in TeX Live it should be `~/texmf` on Linux or `C:/Users/username/texmf` on Windows).

> This package is still in early development, there are many bugs and missing features. Use at your own risk.

## Build the documentation

You only have to `cd` into the documentation folder (`doc/latex/tikzmusic`) and run

```
$ arara tikzmusic
```
